History

This is another of my old fonts used to make inscriptions on stone. I created
the MedievalSharp font in around 1995 like my other fonts - when I started doing
inscriptions on stone professionally. It's based on gothic letters. Initially
the font contained only capitals and digits, and later I made missing small
fonts and some basical signs. In 2010 I started convert my typeface designs 
into digital fonts. The first was NovaCut and all the Nova family,
and here's another...
